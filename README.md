### Introduction
The objective of this project was to improve the performance of a face recognition system using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) combined with data augmentation techniques. 
Face recognition is a critical task in computer vision with applications ranging from security systems to personalized user interfaces. 
The challenge lies in accurately identifying faces under varying conditions such as different poses and lighting.

### Methodology
Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
PCA was employed to reduce the dimensionality of the face image dataset while retaining its essential features. 
By projecting the data onto a lower-dimensional subspace defined by the principal components, PCA helps in extracting the most significant patterns and variations present in the images.

### Data Augmentation:
To enhance the robustness of the face recognition system, various data augmentation techniques were applied:
- Rotation Augmentation: Images were rotated by 90 degrees clockwise and counterclockwise using OpenCV (cv2.rotate).
  This augmentation aimed to simulate different facial orientations that the system might encounter during recognition tasks.

### Objective
The primary goal was to reduce the Euclidean distance metric between the query image and its best match during face recognition.
This metric serves as a measure of similarity between images, crucial for accurate identification across different poses and conditions.

### Outcome

- Improved Recognition Performance:

The incorporation of PCA and rotation augmentation led to a noticeable reduction in the Euclidean distance between the query images and their best matches. 
This improvement indicates that the system became more adept at recognizing faces despite variations in pose.

- Enhanced Robustness:
The data augmentation techniques helped in capturing additional variations that were not present in the original dataset.
This enhanced the system's robustness against factors like pose variations, contributing to more reliable face recognition results.

### Conclusion
By leveraging PCA for dimensionality reduction and implementing rotation augmentation, this project successfully demonstrated a practical approach to enhancing face recognition systems. The combination of these techniques not only improved recognition accuracy but also increased the system's ability to handle real-world challenges where faces may appear in different orientations.
